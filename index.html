                Hi! My Name is Paulina Gómez and I am a graphic designer in
                search for digital knowledge. As designers obviously our carrier
                is focus in the design applied to different things, such as web
                pages, apps, print out media, digital publicity, etc. Although
                we saw just the design part of each platform, as graphic
                designers our studies are centered in print out media.
                Unfortunately, print out media is slowly dying so out core
                knowledge has to change as well. Considering as well that at the
                demand for digital media and tools is growing really fast. So,
                for now I am in sponge mode to get as much knowledge as I can.
                <br /><br />
                Well, as for fun facts about me. I really love painting though I
                don´t paint much at the moment. I am an active fan of all the
                European Royal Houses when talking about general culture. They
                are my guilty pleasure; I can go from the death of the Romanovs
                up until the fight of a few months ago between Queen Letizia of
                Spain and Mother Queen Sofia. Next I would have to say would be
                Mythology, specially the Greek’s and Roman’s. I really love this
                topic since is naturally related to paintings, sculptures, and
                art in general. My favorite museum would definitely be The Met
                in NYC.
